% fooof_unpack_results() - Extract model fit results from FOOOFResults.
%
% Usage:
%   >> results_out = fooof_unpack_results(fooof_results);
%
% Inputs:
%   fooof_results   = FOOOFResults object
% Outputs:
%   results_out     = fooof model results, in a struct, including:
%       results_out.background_params
%       results_out.peak_params
%       results_out.gaussian_params
%       results_out.error
%       results_out.r_squared
%
% Notes:
%   This function is mostly an internal function, and doesn't need to be
%   called directly by the user - but can be if you are interacting
%   directly with FOOOF objects.

    results_out.peak_params = ...
        transpose(reshape(temp, 3, length(temp) / 3));
    
    temp = double(py.array.array('d', results_in.gaussian_params.ravel));

    % Note: r_squared seems to come out as float
    %   It's not clear why this value is different, but doesn't seem
    %   to require the type casting like other (code commented below)
